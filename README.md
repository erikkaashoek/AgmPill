# AgmPill

AgmPill is a low cost FPGA/CPLD dev-board based on AG1280Q48.

AG1280 family provides low cost, ultra-low power CPLDs, with density is 1280 Look-Up Tables(LUTs). 
The devices feature Embedded Block Memory (EBR), Distributed RAM, and Phase Locked Loops (PLLs). 
The devices are designed for ultra low power and cost while providing programmable solutions for a wide 
range of applications, especially in consumer and mobile device products.
